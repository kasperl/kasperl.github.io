    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      The work presented in this thesis was done in OOVM A/S, a small startup
      company consisting of the two authors and Lars Bak. The mission of
      OOVM A/S is to improve reliability, availability, and servicability of embedded
      software by introducing a new software platform. The platform
      consists of several components. The design of the components is the result
      of animated discussions at the whiteboard between the three of us. This
      thesis will focus on the virtual machine and the system software, both
      of which were implemented by the authors. The programming environment,
      source code compiler, and garbage collector were implemented by
      Lars Bak.

      We wish to thank our thesis supervisor, Ole Lehrmann Madsen, for
      encouraging us to focus on the written part of the thesis in addition to
      the software implementation. We also wish to thank Lars Bak, as well
      as Steffen Grarup who has recently joined the OOVM team. Both have
      made themselves available for technical discussions, and have provided
      useful feedback on the different parts of this thesis. We look forward to
      continuing to work together with you in the future. Furthermore, Mads
      Torgersen deserves special thanks for many enlightening discussions on
      object-orientation, reviewing the thesis, and for always bringing cake to
      our meetings. Finally, we wish to thank all the others who have read and
      provided feedback on this thesis. We really appreciate your efforts in helping
      us ensure the accuracy and readability of this thesis.

    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p>
      More than 90% of the microprocessors produced today are used in embedded
      devices. With the current development tools, it is exceedingly difficult
      to debug, profile, and update code running on embedded devices in operation.
      This leaves developers unable to diagnose and solve software issues
      on deployed embedded systems, something that is unacceptable for an industry
      where robustness is paramount.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this thesis, we show that it is possible to build a fully serviceable
      software platform that fits on memory-constrained embedded devices. We
      use virtual machine technology to enable full serviceability even for system
      software components. At the bottom of the software stack, we have replaced
      real-time operating systems with an efficient 30 KB object-oriented
      virtual machine. The virtual machine contains a reflective interface that allows
      developers to debug, profile, and update code running on embedded
      devices even in operation. The serviceability extends to system software
      components, including interrupt handlers, device drivers, and networking
      protocols. Like any other components, the system software components
      are implemented in safe, compact virtual machine instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our virtual machine uses an interpreter to execute both system software
      and applications. On average, our interpreter is more than twice as
      fast as the closest competitor for low-end embedded devices. It even outperforms
      the fastest Java interpreter available. Compared to other object-oriented
      virtual machines, our compact memory representation of objects
      allows us to reduce the amount of memory spent on classes, methods, and
      strings by 40-50%. The result is that our entire software stack fits in less
      than 128 KB of memory. This way, our platform enables serviceability on a
      wide range of industrial and consumer devices; something we believe will
      revolutionize the way embedded software is developed and maintained.
