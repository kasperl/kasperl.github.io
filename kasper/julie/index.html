           Child nutrition specialist at <a href="http://www.arla.com/">Arla
           Foods</a> where I am responsible for developing scientific
           marketing material to health care professionals along with consumer material and
           training material for our teams around the world. The focus of the material is infant and maternal nutrition. Being a nutrition
           specialist, I also give input to product development and I approve packaging
           designs according to Arla and <a href="http://www.who.int/">WHO</a> guidelines. I work with a number of
           consultants around the world and the marketing material we produce
           is widely used in the Dominican Republic, Bangladesh, and
           China. I also teach and arrange internal training for
           our marketing and sales departments.

           Foods</a> where I spent 5 months setting up a web site with
           nutritional contents for our two main brands, <a href="http://www.milex.com/">Milex</a> and
           Dano. The web site focuses on infant and maternal
           nutrition and development and during the summer of 2008, I was responsible for and succesfully managed
           the six employeed students that helped develop the content for the website.

	  level. I also sorted, cataloged, and upgraded the chemicals
	  at the school and I took charge of setting up a system for
          keeping track of the chemicals, thus ensuring safe keeping and
          timely ordering of needed chemicals.

        <td>
          M.Sc. in medical chemistry from the <a href="http://www.chem.au.dk/">University of Aarhus</a>. My master's thesis,
	  <a href="http://verdich.dk/kasper/julie/EF-Tu.pdf">"Molecular Modelling of EF-Tu"</a>,
          relates to rational drug design of antibiotics targeting the EF-Tu protein, which plays an essential role in the 
          synthesis of proteins. The work involves de novo design using 
          Cerius2, rigid-protein and induced fit dockings using 
          Maestro,
          and simulations of molecular dynamics using 
          <a href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/">NAMD</a>. To evaluate the real-world relevance of the 
          designed ligands and fitness computations, I collaborated 
          with the protein crystallography          
          and synthetic organic chemistry groups at the 
          University of Aarhus.

          B.Sc. in medical chemistry from the <a href="http://www.chem.au.dk/">University of Aarhus</a>, where I wrote 
          my bachelor's thesis, <a href="http://verdich.dk/kasper/julie/ER.pdf">"The Estrogen Receptor"</a>, under the supervision
          of <a href="http://www.chem.au.dk/da/staff/index.html?action=3&amp;person_id=198">Birgit Schi√∏tt</a>. In my thesis, I examined 
          the effects estrogen-like molecules can have on the estrogen receptors 
          using computer-aided docking simulations. 
          In particular, I screened a set of pesticides to determine if any of them have effects on either of the estrogen receptors. The 
          thesis shows that 
          computer-aided docking simulations is a promising novel way of determining the effect different compounds can have on receptors in 
          the human body. I succeeded in reproducing the established results for the known ligands and found that pesticides may
          effect the estrogen receptor. The successful reproduction of the results for the known ligands gives hope to the future of this 
          kind of research, because it creates new ways of testing compounds before sending them on the market.
